# qiloop

This is work in progress, you have been warned.

`qiloop` is an implementation of the QiMessaging protocol written in the
Go programming language.

For more information about QiMessaging, here are some notes [about QiMessaging](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/doc/NOTES.md).

Installation
------------

Please install [Go 1.10](https://golang.org/dl/).

```
go get -d -t github.com/lugu/qiloop/...
go generate github.com/lugu/qiloop/type/object
go generate github.com/lugu/qiloop/meta/stage2
go generate github.com/lugu/qiloop/bus/services
```

Proxy generation
----------------

By default, `qiloop` comes with only two generated services:
ServiceManager and LogManager (package
github.com/lugu/qiloop/bus/services).

If you want to generate more proxies, you will need access to a
running QiMessaging server. The proxies are generated by introspecting
the running services.

Here is how to generate proxies given a running server on port 9559:

```
go run github.com/lugu/qiloop/bus/scan -qi-url localhost:9559 -proxy proxy.go
```

This generates `proxy.go` which gives access to all the discovered
services. Please refer to bus/services/demo/cmd/proxy/main.go for an
example of proxy usage.

Examples
--------

- [info
  demo](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/bus/cmd/info/main.go)
  illustrates how to call a service: it lists the services registered
  to the service directory.


- [signal
  demo](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/bus/services/demo/cmd/signal/main.go)
  illustrates how to subscribe to a signal: it prints a log each time
  a service is removed from the service directory.

Status
------

The project is under rapid evolution. Currently, the client part is
mostly working (except properties). So one should be able to use
qiloop to call a service and subscribe to a signal. Don't expect more
than this.

What is working:

- TCP connection
- Proxy generation
- Call and signals
- IDL generation
- TLS transport
- Authentication

What is under development:

- IDL parsing

What is yet to be done:

- Service stub generation
- Service properties
