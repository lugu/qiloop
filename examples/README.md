# Examples

## Basic examples

- [hello world](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/say)
  illustrates how to call a method of a service: this example calls
  the method 'say' of a text to speech service.

- [signal registration](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/signal)
  illustrates how to subscribe to a signal: this example prints a
  log each time a service is added to the service directory.

## Examples for NAO and Pepper

- [animated say](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/animated-say)
  uses ALAnimatedSpeech to animate the robot.

- [posture](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/posture)
  puts the robot in a random position.

- [motion](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/motion)
  move the robot forward and demonstrate how to cancel a call.

- [memory](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/memory)
  uses ALMemory to react on a touch event.

## Examples of service implementation

- [ping pong service](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/pong)
  illustrates how to implement a service.

- [space service](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/space)
  illustrates the client side objects creation.

- [clock service](https://github.com/lugu/qiloop/blob/master/examples/clock)
  completed version of the clock tutorial.
